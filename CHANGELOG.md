# Changelog

## 2018-10-27 0.4

* Add full support for booru-wizard 0.3 output format.

## 2018-09-21 0.3

* First 'formal' release.

* The userscript works with nonstandard HTTP port numbers.

* Fixed a bug with certain browsers (specifically Firefox that I observed it in) where the 'Mass Upload' link is made multiple times when the page is revisited by the 'Back' button.

* Prevented the uploader from sending the image data twice, unnecessarily using bandwidth.
