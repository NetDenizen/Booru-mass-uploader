# Booru mass uploader 1.1

This userscript is a fork of the one maintained at https://github.com/Seedmanc/Booru-mass-uploader and the original will be monitored for updates, which will be selectively merged back into this one.

The primary change to this script is to allow it to accept JSON files that control the metadata with which an image is uploaded. Use in conjunction with the software at https://github.com/NetDenizen/booru-wizard was a main consideration in the development of the script. Thus, Most of the manual controls which would have served the same purpose in the previous version have been removed.

These JSON files should follow the schema at https://github.com/NetDenizen/booru-wizard/blob/master/output_schema.json As with the original version, a link to the uploader interface is added to the \*booru page

It can be downloaded here: https://netdenizen.github.io/Booru-mass-uploader/booru.mass.uploader.user.js

Here is a screenshot of what the interface will look like. Note that small variations in appearance are likely due to the web browser and operating system, rather than changes in the software itself.
